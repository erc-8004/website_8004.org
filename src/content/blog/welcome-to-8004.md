We're excited to launch the official ERC-8004 community website. This is the home for builders creating autonomous agents on open protocols.

## What is ERC-8004?

ERC-8004 is the Agent Identity Standard - an open protocol that enables discovery, trust, and payments for autonomous AI agents.

## Get Involved

Join our community on [Telegram](https://t.me/ERC8004) to connect with other builders and stay updated on the latest developments.
